Blade's original UI plugin for win32, written in MFC, with the help of some 3rd party libraries, i.e.

1. MultiPaneCtrl (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/93521/MultiPaneCtrl)

2. DockedRebar (havily modified. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7308/TabedReBar-Control)

3. EnTabCtrl (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1786/Ownerdraw-Tab-Controls-Borders-and-All)



IMPORTANT: this plugin is now deprecated, use QtPlugin is highly recommened.

Major concerns on using Qt:


1. Cross platform
2. High DPI auto adjust
3. better C++ coding style that MFC
